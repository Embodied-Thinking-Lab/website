    <p>
        The Embodied Thinking Lab is an independent research lab focused on 
        the intersection of deep learning and robotics.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We develop machine systems that think and act in the physical world, 
        designing both the physical machines and the intelligence.
    </p>
    
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> 
            We're currently working on Synapse-r, integrating structured reasoning 
            with diffusion based policy learning for adaptive robotic control.
