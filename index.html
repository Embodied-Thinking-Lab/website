    <h1>The Embodied Thinking Lab</h1>
    
    <p>The Embodied Thinking Lab is an independent research lab focused on the intersection of deep learning and robotics</p>
    <p>We develop machine systems that think and act in the physical world, designing both the physical machines and the intelligence</p>

    <p>We're currently working on Synapse-r, integrating structured reasoning with diffusion based policy learning for adaptive robotic control</p>
